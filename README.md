Smart Converter

A reimagined unit converter built for iOS, focusing on cinematic aesthetics, fluid interactivity, and instant utility.

- Overview

Smart Converter strips away the complexity of traditional conversion apps. There are no dropdowns to fumble with and no "Calculate" buttons to press. You simply enter a number, and the app instantly populates the most relevant conversions across Temperature, Length, Weight, and Speed.

Designed with a bold, futuristic UI, it features "Aurora" mesh gradients, hyper-glassmorphism, and smooth micro-interactions that make simple utility feel like a premium experience.

 - Design Philosophy

This project was built to push the boundaries of SwiftUI, aiming for the title of "Most Beautiful App of 2025."

Aurora Backgrounds: Deep, living mesh gradients that shift subtly behind the content.

Hyper-Glassmorphism: Multi-layered blur effects with delicate white borders and shadows.

Cinematic Typography: Large, thin, rounded fonts inspired by high-end editorial design.

Fluid Input: A single, glowing input field that drives the entire interface.

- Features

Instant Multi-Conversion: Type once, see results for Celsius, Fahrenheit, Miles, Kilometers, Pounds, KG, and more simultaneously.

One-Tap Copy: Tap any card to instantly copy the result to your clipboard with haptic feedback.

Adaptive Layout: Fully responsive scroll view with sticky headers and dynamic spacing.

Dark Mode Native: Built from the ground up for OLED screens with deep blacks and vibrant neons.
